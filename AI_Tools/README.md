# AI Tools Section

This folder demonstrates how I used AI tools to assist with one part of the assignment.

## Content

- Description of Claude AI assistant
- Prompt engineering examples used for model creation
- Reflection on Claude's effectiveness and limitations
- Discussion of how Claude could benefit data science students

## Tool Used

I used Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) to assist with the Machine Learning model creation part of this assignment.

## Approach

I provided Claude with:
- The dataset description and features
- My specific goals for the model (predicting student pass/fail)
- Questions about model selection between Logistic Regression and Random Forest

Claude helped me:
- Understand the appropriate preprocessing steps
- Implement the classification models
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score
- Interpret the results

## Reflection

**Strengths:**
- Claude provided clear explanations of model concepts
- Helped troubleshoot errors in my implementation
- Suggested best practices for model evaluation

**Limitations:**
- Some code required modification to work with my specific dataset
- I needed to verify the statistical interpretations independently

## Potential Benefits for Students

Claude and similar AI assistants can help students:
- Get unstuck when facing coding or conceptual challenges
- Understand complex machine learning concepts through explanations
- Learn best practices for model building and evaluation
- Explore alternative approaches they might not have considered
- Receive immediate feedback on their solutions

These tools serve as supplementary resources that can enhance learning without replacing the fundamental understanding needed in data science.
